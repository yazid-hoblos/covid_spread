# COVID Spread — Streamlit App

This repository contains an interactive Streamlit app to explore the COVID-19 dataset used in this project. The app provides top-N bar charts, time series, and choropleth maps (static and animated) built from aggregated data.

It also presents all outputs and scripts used in the project.

## Quick overview
- App entry: `app.py`
- Data source: `data.csv` (expected at project root or pass a different path in the code)
- Plot outputs (when generated by other scripts): `plots/` (HTML and PNG thumbnails)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (3.10 tested)
- Recommended packages (install from project `requirements.txt`):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Run the app locally
1. From the project root, start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open the address printed by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser.

3. Sidebar controls:
   - Continent: filter the dataset to a continent and the maps will zoom accordingly.
   - Month: filter to a specific YYYY-MM if available.
   - Country: optionally focus on a single country.
   - Map mode: choose between a static map for the current filter, an animated map by month, or a month slider.

## Map zooming behavior
- When a continent is selected, the app computes a continent-specific view (scope, center, zoom) and applies it to the Plotly map. 

## Generating and saving maps
- The app displays interactive Plotly figures inside Streamlit. Separate scripts in `bin/` (for example `bin/dynamic.py` and `bin/europe.py`) are provided to generate interactive HTML files thumbnails into `plots/` for inclusion in the LaTeX report.
- To run those scripts:
  ```bash
  # generate global animated map
  python3 bin/spark_scripts/dynamic.py

  # generate Europe animated map
  python3 bin/spark_scripts/europe.py
  ```

After running the scripts you should find:
- `plots/dynamic_map.html` 
- `plots/europe_dynamic_map.html`
